# Intern Training Program

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the intern training program. Each intern is required to submit their own folder containing their personal materials and assignments.

## Structure
Each intern should create a folder with their name/ID and include:
- **Self Introduction**: A markdown file introducing yourself, your background, and technical skills
- **Code Solutions**: Algorithm implementations and coding exercises
- **Other Materials**: Any additional learning materials or project work

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a folder with your identifier (e.g., `ts-haoyang.a.liu`)
2. Add your introduction and code files inside your folder
3. Follow the markdown format for documentation
4. Keep your submissions organized and well-documented
